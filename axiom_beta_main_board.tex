\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Equivalent to a PC's motherboard for the camera
    \item A central hub, where all the data from sensors and other interfaces 
        are routed as per need
    \item Hosts two medium-speed shield connectors and two high-speed plugin module
        slot connectors
    \item Bottom side interfaces with the power board, followed by MicroZed board
    \item Top side interfaces with the interface board, and shields

        acceleration etc. (as directly behind the image sensor)
    \item 2x board connectors (JX1 \& JX2) at North and South of board, connect directly
        to the Zynq SoC GPIOs (on the MicroZed board) through the power board

    \item 4x Power headers (PWR-XX), to receive various power rails from power board
    \item 2x PIC16s (West and East), to interface with the routing fabrics through
        various interfaces like JTAG, I2C, SPI etc.
    \end{itemize}

    \item A Centre Solder-On (CSO) area
    \item 2x board interface connectors (X-WEST \& X-EAST) that interface with the 
        interface board 
    \item 2x pin header connectors each on the West (HDR-XW) and East (HDR-XE) side, to 
        interface with the West shield and East shield respectively
    \item 2x Lattice MachXO2 FPGAs (RFW \& RFE) used as routing fabrics, to route connections
        from the shields, plugins and centre area to the Zynq SoC (on MicroZed board)
